* Research Questions
- Spatial :: Do levels of black carbon vary in different locations
             around Gould Hall? (We hypothesize that levels will be
             higher closer to high-traffic streets such as 15th.)
- Temporal :: Do levels of black carbon vary over the course of the
              day? (We hypothesize that levels will correlate to
              traffic volumes.)

* A Tale of Two Sampling Strategies
** Spatial
- 10 minute sample frames
- locations: University Way, 40th St, 15th Ave, Green Wall
- 30 second sample rate, 100ml flow
- repeated over 4 days
** Temporal
- Continuous sample frame, approx 1 week
- 3rd floor window overlooking NE 40th street, west side
- 300 second sample rate, 100ml flow
